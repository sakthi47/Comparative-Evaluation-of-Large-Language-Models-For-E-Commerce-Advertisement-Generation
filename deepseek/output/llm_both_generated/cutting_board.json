  "deepseek_optimized_prompt": "**AI Image Generation Prompt:**  \n\n\"A modern, professional product photo of a sleek, sandalwood-colored rectangular wooden cutting board with a smooth finish and a cylindrical hole for hanging, placed diagonally on a clean, minimalist marble countertop. The board should be slightly elevated at an angle to showcase its thickness and texture, with a chef\u2019s knife resting on top to imply functionality. Soft, diffused natural lighting highlights the wood grain and creates subtle shadows for depth. The background is a neutral, light-toned kitchen setting with blurred-out greenery or kitchenware for a fresh, airy feel. The mood is elegant yet practical, with warm, earthy tones complementing the sandalwood, evoking a premium and clutter-free kitchen aesthetic. The composition is tightly framed to emphasize the product, with negative space for ad copy overlay.\"",
